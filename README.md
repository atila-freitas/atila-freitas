### Data Consultant at Trixlog ðŸ”­

I'm currently working as Data Consultant at Trixlog (B2B enterprise in vehicular telemetry), but I've worked as Data Science Leader, and Data Analyst at TrixLog too. I have expertise with Python language, Flask framework to develop API, Pandas frameworks for data analyzes, Pentaho Data Integration for ETL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases. I currently use clustering algorithms (DBScan, K-means, for example) for our projects. I've worked at Nama.ai as Data Engineer, a company that combines human and artificial intelligence to improve the consumer experience on a large scale implementing Data Architecture for a bank project.

### At University :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I worked in search-based software engineering (SBSE) developing metaheuristics algorithms to resolve hard problems of software engineering, like next release problem. I have an article using NSGA-II with In-Vitro-based technics, to improve the performance of NSGA-II. Now, I'm a Master's Degree Student at Federal University of CearÃ¡, studying Digital Image Processing with Machine Learning application.

SBSE works:

### Studies :closed_book:

I am currently learning Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, reading "Rules Without Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention" and "The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect". Passionate about causal learning. In addition, I am currently improving my second language (English).
