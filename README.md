### Data Engineer at Nama.ai ðŸ”­

I'm currently working at Nama.ai as Data Engineer, a company that combines human and artificial intelligence to improve the consumer experience on a large scale. I've worked as Data Science Leader, and Data Analyst at TrixLog (B2B enterprise in vehicular telemetry). I have expertise with Python language, Flask framework to develop API, Pandas frameworks for data analyzes, Pentaho Data Integration for ETL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases. I currently use clustering algorithms (DBScan, K-means, for example) for our projects.

Nama projects:

- Working on that... :hammer_and_pick:

Trixlog projects:

- Heatmap of accidents (DBScan)
- Heatmap of millions behaviors (K-means)
- Idleness of fleet (Python, S3, Power BI and Pentaho Data Integration)
- Security Notifications in real-time (MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Python)

### At University :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I worked in search-based software engineering (SBSE) developing metaheuristics algorithms to resolve hard problems of software engineering, like next release problem. I have an article using NSGA-II with In-Vitro-based technics, to improve the performance of NSGA-II. Now, I'm a Master's Degree Student at Federal University of CearÃ¡, studying Digital Image Processing with Machine Learning application.

SBSE works:
